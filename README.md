# Deep-Learning-Coursera-Specialisation
This repository has all of the Coursera Deep-Learning specialization assignments taught by Andrew N G with a brief description of the topics by me.
Below, I will give a breif description of each lab assignments which might give a generic idea to someone who isn't able to do the course on Coursera. 
I geniunely reccomend you to take up the course if you are interested in deep learning as Andrew is one of the best at what he does.
